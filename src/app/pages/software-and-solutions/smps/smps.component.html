  The SMPS is an Android-based Milk Procurement System specifically designed to cater to the needs of VLCC and its members. It performs key operations such as measuring/weighing milk, indicating fat and SNF percentages, calculating the amount payable to each member, and recording member numbers, date-time, and shift details through slip printing. At the end of each session, a report is generated for VLCC records, detailing member numbers, milk procured in liters, fat content, and amounts payable to each member. Additionally, a cycle-wise ledger is produced for each member, summarizing total milk supplied and the corresponding amount payable for the period. The SMPSis a cost-effective solution for small village-level collection centers, and it includes integration with a weigh scale and milk testing machine.

          The SMPS operates on any Android-based smartphone or tablet and can be easily downloaded from the Google Play Store. It is user-friendly and requires minimal maintenance. The system interfaces with electronic weighing scales, Bluetooth thermal printers, and milk testing machines (MTM) or milk analyzers. A digital indicator displays customer details, including code, milk quantity, fat content, SNF levels, and the amount due. The system can store unlimited data and features automatic cloud backup of the entire database. Security is ensured as SMPS requires a password for configuration. In case of serial link failures with the weighing scale or fat testing machine, a manual system is available. The SMPS screen mirrors the scale and MTM readings during milk dumping and testing. Additionally, SMPS supports data export in various formats, accessible via the internet or media such as SMS, WhatsApp, email, or SQL Server on the cloud.
